## Responsive Layout 
This project is intent to brief you about the responsive layout and css page structuring using CSS FLEXBox and GRID layout. 





### Basic Page Structure

**Viewport**

The visible area of a browser window where a webpage can be displayed.

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

"width=device-width"  - Width would be the device width
"initial-scale=1.0"   - One pixel on the screen equal to one device independent pixel. That means the page is not zoomed in or out when the page is loaded.

If you want to stop/restrict user from zooming then you could use following values 
    -   user-scalable
    -   minimum-scale
    -   maximum-scale
